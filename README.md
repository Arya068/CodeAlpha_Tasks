The user enters or selects their date of birth through an input field, and upon clicking the "Calculate Age" button, the program computes the difference between the current date and the birth date. The output is then displayed dynamically on the web page.


The Age Calculator is useful in real-life situations like completing online forms, verifying age-based eligibility, or simply serving as a quick tool for users to know their exact age
